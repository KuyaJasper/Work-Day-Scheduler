# Work-Day-Scheduler

For this project we needed to use Moment libary to display the current date and time at the top of a workday scheduler.

Within the scheduler, we needed to be able to use local storage to save the user's data.

The scheduler also needed to change color depending on what time of day it was. This code was provided in the .css file.
